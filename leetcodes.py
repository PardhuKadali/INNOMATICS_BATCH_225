        Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits
        You are given a positive integer num consisting of exactly four digits. Split num into two new integers new1 and
        new2 by using the digits found in num. Leading zeros are allowed in new1 and new2, and all the digits found
        in num must be used.
        
        For example, given num = 2932, you have the following digits: two 2's, one 9 and one 3. Some of the
        possible pairs [new1, new2] are [22, 93], [23, 92], [223, 9] and [2, 329].
        
        Return the minimum possible sum of new1 and new2.
        
        Example 1:
        
        Input: num = 2932
        Output: 52
        Explanation: Some possible pairs [new1, new2] are [29, 23], [223, 9], etc.

        Implement the ParkingSystem class:

        ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class.
        The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
        bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get 
        into the parking lot. 
        carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 
        A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. 
        If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.
 

        Example 1:

        Input

        [[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]

        For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
        Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists)

        Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting

        the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
        Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits.
        For example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
        Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k,
        repeat from step 1.Return s after all rounds have been completed.

        Input: s = "11111222223", k = 3

        Explanation: 
        - For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: "111", "112", "222", and "23".
          ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
          So, s becomes "3" + "4" + "6" + "5" = "3465" after the first round.
        - For the second round, we divide s into "346" and "5".
          Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
          So, s becomes "13" + "5" = "135" after second round.

        For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
        For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]
        For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]
        So, we will return 18.
        It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.
